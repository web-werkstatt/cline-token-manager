## 📰 **HackerNews Strategy**

### **HN Post Title & Description:**
```
Title: "Real-time AI Coding Cost Tracking with 70% Token Reduction (Open Source)"

Description:
We built a VS Code extension that solves the "AI coding cost explosion" problem. 

The issue: AI coding tools like Cline start at 2k tokens per request, but exponentially grow to 40k+ tokens, causing API failures and $500+ monthly bills.

Our solution: Event-driven real-time token tracking + ML optimization engine achieving 70%+ reduction while preserving quality.

Key features:
- Real-time file watcher (no polling, starts at true zero)
- Python ML engine with TF-IDF + conversation flow analysis  
- Professional admin dashboard with business intelligence
- 24 VS Code commands for comprehensive optimization
- Open source (MIT) with transparent algorithms

This started as a simple Cline token counter but evolved into enterprise-grade cost management after community feedback. We're now supporting multiple AI coding tools.

The codebase includes both TypeScript (for universal compatibility) and Python (for advanced ML optimization) engines.

## 🎯 **Community Response Templates**

### **Common Questions & Answers:**

**Q: "How is this different from Cursor?"**
A: "Cursor is amazing but editor-locked. We bring similar intelligence to VS Code + any AI tool. Think of us as complementary - Cursor for coding, us for cost optimization across all AI tools."

**Q: "Why not just use Cursor's built-in features?"**  
A: "Cursor doesn't support Cline, and costs are hidden. We provide transparent cost tracking + work with any AI tool in VS Code. Universal platform vs single-tool solution."

**Q: "Is the Python engine really necessary?"**
A: "TypeScript gets you 50% reduction, Python ML gets 70%+. Both work, Python is optional for power users who want maximum optimization."

**Q: "What about privacy/security?"**
A: "Everything runs locally. No data sent to external servers. Open source code auditable. MIT licensed."

**Q: "Enterprise features?"**
A: "Admin dashboard is production-ready. Planning Professional tier ($29/mo) for advanced analytics, team features coming Q3 2025."
